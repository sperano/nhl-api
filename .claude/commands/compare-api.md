description: Compare implementation with nhl-api-py reference
---

Compare the Rust implementation with the Python reference (nhl-api-py):

1. Check if {{feature}} exists in the Python implementation
2. Compare API design and method signatures
3. Identify any missing functionality
4. Note differences in approach or design decisions
5. Suggest improvements or missing features to add

This ensures feature parity with the Python library.
