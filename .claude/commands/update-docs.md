description: Update documentation for recent changes
---

Review and update documentation:

1. Check `README.md` for outdated information
2. Review doc comments in changed files
3. Ensure all public APIs have doc comments with:
   - Clear descriptions
   - Example usage
   - API endpoint URLs (for client methods)
   - Error conditions
4. Update CHANGELOG.md if it exists
5. Verify examples in docs still work

Focus on clarity and completeness.
